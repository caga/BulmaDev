### Html Development Environment with Bulma/Sass/Fontawesome 
Everything is preset for basic frontend development with Bulma. What you should do is
to run sass in bulma directory with the command: 

    sass --watch bulma.sass:bulma.css

This will update the **bulma.css** for any change in _**bulma.sass**_ 

Relative links to folders are also included in index.html for bulma.css and fontawesome.
I use (and love) **Vim** with **Bracey** plugin which render any change in html live. So i advise the same :)

Happy coding
